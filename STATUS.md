## Summary: Project Management System Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Updates

1. **Frontend Components**: 
   - Updated all project detail page interfaces to use new schema
   - Added beautiful skeleton loading animations 
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

2. **API Routes**: 
   - `/api/projects/[id]` - Updated to use project_assignments table
   - `/api/projects/[id]/users` - Updated for user assignment management
   - `/api/projects/[id]/files` - Updated for file access control
   - All routes now use `assigned_user_id` instead of `user_id`

3. **Database Schema**: 
   - Created fix script with correct column names
   - Proper foreign key relationships defined
   - Added `project_role` field for user roles within projects

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Action

**You need to execute the database fix in Supabase:**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the content from `database/fix-foreign-keys.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute

This will:
- Drop and recreate the `project_assignments` table with correct column names
- Add proper foreign key constraints that match the API expectations
- Set up Row Level Security policies

### üéØ Expected Result

After running the database fix:
- Project detail pages will load without "Project not found" errors
- Skeleton loading animations will show during data fetching
- User assignment/removal will work properly  
- File upload permissions will be correctly enforced
- All foreign key relationships will resolve correctly

### üîß Current Issue

The API is looking for `project_assignments_assigned_user_id_fkey` foreign key relationship, but the current database has `assigned_to` instead of `assigned_user_id`. The fix script corrects this mismatch.

Once you run the database fix, your complete project management system should be fully functional!
