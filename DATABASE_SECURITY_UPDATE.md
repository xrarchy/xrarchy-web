# 🔐 Database Security Update Required

## ⚠️ Important: Your Database Needs RLS Policies

Your role-based access control system is **fully implemented in the application code**, but you need to **update your Supabase database policies** to match the security model.

Currently:
- ✅ **Frontend**: Role-based UI with conditional buttons and access controls
- ✅ **Backend API**: Server-side role filtering and permission checks  
- ❌ **Database**: Missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies for direct database access

## 🚨 Why This Matters

Without proper RLS policies, users could potentially:
- Access data through direct database queries
- Bypass your API security measures
- See projects they shouldn't have access to

## 🎯 Quick Fix (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Apply RLS Policies
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the content from: `database/role-based-rls-policies.sql`
3. Click **"Run"** to execute all policies

### Step 2: Verify Installation  
1. In the same **SQL Editor**, run the content from: `database/verify-rls-policies.sql`
2. Check that all tables show "✅ RLS Enabled"
3. Confirm all 4 tables have 4 policies each

## 📋 What Gets Updated

### Tables Secured:
- **`projects`** - Role-based project access
- **`project_assignments`** - Assignment management
- **`files`** - File upload/download permissions
- **`profiles`** - User profile access

### Role Permissions Applied:
- 🔴 **Admin**: Full access to everything
- 🟡 **Archivist**: Edit assigned projects, upload files
- 🔵 **User**: Read-only access to assigned projects

### Performance Optimized:
- 7 custom indexes added for fast policy evaluation
- Optimized queries for role-based filtering

## 🎉 After Applying Policies

Your system will have **complete security**:

1. **Database Level**: RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
2. **API Level**: Server-side role checking and filtering  
3. **UI Level**: Conditional rendering based on permissions

## ⚡ Test Your Security

After applying the policies, test with different user roles:

1. **Admin User**: Should see all projects, full CRUD access
2. **Archivist User**: Should see only assigned projects, edit access
3. **Regular User**: Should see only assigned projects, read-only

## 📁 Files Created

- `database/role-based-rls-policies.sql` - Main policy installation script
- `database/verify-rls-policies.sql` - Verification and testing script
- `docs/RLS_POLICIES.md` - Detailed policy documentation
- `scripts/update-rls-policies.js` - Alternative JS-based installer (requires exec_sql function)

## 🔍 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the verification script results
2. Review the detailed policy documentation in `docs/RLS_POLICIES.md`
3. Ensure your database has the correct table structure

Your role-based access control system is **99% complete** - just needs these database policies to be fully secure! 🔒
