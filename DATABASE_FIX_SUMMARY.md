# Database Relationship Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The error "Could not find a relationship between 'project_files' and 'profiles' in the schema cache" was caused by incorrect foreign key relationship syntax in the Supabase queries.

## Root Cause
The API was using an incorrect foreign key hint `project_files_uploaded_by_fkey` that doesn't exist in the database schema. The correct approach is to use the actual column name `uploaded_by` that references `profiles(id)`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `/api/projects/[id]/files/route.ts` (GET endpoint)
**Before:**
```typescript
uploaded_by:profiles!project_files_uploaded_by_fkey(
    id,
    email
)
```

**After:**
```typescript
uploaded_by,
profiles!uploaded_by(
    id,
    email
)
```

### 2. Fixed `/api/projects/[id]/files/route.ts` (POST endpoint)
**Before:**
```typescript
uploaded_by:profiles!project_files_uploaded_by_fkey(id, email)
```

**After:**
```typescript
uploaded_by,
profiles!uploaded_by(id, email)
```

### 3. Fixed `/api/projects/[id]/route.ts` 
**Issues Fixed:**
- Changed from `files` table to `project_files` table
- Updated column names to match schema:
  - `name` â†’ `filename`
  - `size` â†’ `file_size`
  - `created_at` â†’ `uploaded_at`

## Database Schema Reference
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS project_files (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
    content_type VARCHAR(255),
    uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),  -- This is the correct column name
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    description TEXT
);
```

## Testing Status
- âœ… Application builds successfully
- âœ… Server starts without errors
- âœ… Files page loads (200 status)
- ðŸ”„ Need to test API calls with authentication

## Next Steps for User
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Login with credentials
3. Go to Projects â†’ Select a project â†’ Files
4. Verify no "Could not find a relationship" errors
5. Test file upload functionality

## Expected Behavior
- Files page should load without database errors
- File listing should work correctly
- File upload should function properly
- User information should display correctly in file listings
